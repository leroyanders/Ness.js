# Introduction

## What is the Ness.js and what does is it means?

The idea of creating this framework was to take all the useful things from similar JavaScript solutions that are most needed and provide them in a more extensive and convenient way to use. We allow you to create modern SSR applications and give you the ability to change and add everything you need to the core in a simple and concise way.

*Ness.js stands for: Newest Experience of Server Side development. That's means that you will be able to fetch data directly from client side components and provide anothers from server entrypoint.*

## Templates and boilerplates

We have a list of templates that you can use when creating a new application with our CLI. For example `typescript` or any other template you are interested in.

## Plugins usebilite

We have a huge list of plugins, that will help's you using modern techniques such as SASS or Stylus. Of course, you also may use your own plugins from local folder application, so you don't need to waste time on configuring them.

## In what situations will it suit me?

You will like our framework, for example, if you need to create an online store or a large CRM system, you will not need to use different programming languages or frameworks (for example, Django). Everything you need is available here.
